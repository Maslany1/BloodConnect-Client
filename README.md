## Overview

BloodConnect-Client is built as a modern web app that feels fast and intuitive. It uses React for the UI, a responsive design with Tailwind and DaisyUI, and Firebase for auth and real-time data. The app supports different user roles, including donors, recipients, and admins, to control access to sensitive features.

The core goals are:
- Help users locate nearby donors with precise distance filtering.
- Provide rich donor profiles with consent and availability information.
- Enable secure donor requests and clear escalation paths.
- Ensure a mobile-first experience that works well on phones and tablets.
- Maintain strong data protection and role-based access controls.

The project is designed to be deployed quickly and scaled as needs grow. It emphasizes reliability, clarity, and accessibility.

- Optional: Stripe account for payment flow testing

Basic setup:
1) Clone the repository
   - git clone https://github.com/Maslany1/BloodConnect-Client.git
2) Install dependencies
   - npm install
   - or yarn install
3) Copy or create environment files
   - Create a .env.local file from a sample
   - Fill in API keys, Firebase config, and Stripe keys
4) Run the app
   - npm run dev
   - Open http://localhost:5173 (or the port your dev server uses)

If you want to run the production-ready build:
- Build: npm run build
- Serve locally: npm run serve

For release assets and installers, visit the Releases page to download the latest build. That page is linked at the top of this document and again in the Release and deployment section.

Notes:
- The app is designed in a feature-first layout. Each feature folder contains its own components, hooks, and tests.
- The public folder hosts static assets and the app shell.

## Authentication and security

- Firebase Authentication handles user login, registration, and session management.
- Admin roles are stored in Firestore with role-based guards in the client.
- Sensitive data is not exposed to the public; clients fetch only the required data with security rules in Firestore.
- Data in transit uses TLS; sensitive keys are stored in environment variables and never committed to code.
- The app supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin accounts where required.

Security practices:
- Use least privilege for service accounts
- Validate inputs on both client and server sides
- Sanitize all data before rendering
- Keep dependencies up to date

---

## Real-time data and state management

- Real-time search results rely on Firestore snapshot listeners for quick updates.
- TanStack Query caches data to reduce duplicate requests and improve responsiveness.
- Websockets or Firestore real-time streams are used for live changes to donor availability or request status.
- State is kept predictable with a clear separation between UI state and server data.

Guidelines:
- Use query keys that reflect data type and filters
- Invalidate queries when a mutating action completes
- Show optimistic updates when appropriate, with a rollback plan on error

---

## Donor profiles and location search

- Donor profiles contain availability, blood type, contact preferences, and verification status.
- Location search uses the browser’s geolocation API (with user consent) and falls back to manual input when needed.
- A map view visualizes donor density and proximity. Users can click markers to view quick profile summaries.
- Privacy controls allow donors to set sharing preferences and contact channels.

Implementation notes:
- Radius-based filtering enables efficient screening of nearby donors
- Pagination or infinite scrolling handles large result sets without overloading the UI
- Accessible controls ensure keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

---

## Payments and donations

- Stripe integration supports donor contributions and in-app donations.
- A secure checkout flow handles payments and receipts.
- Refund policies, donation receipts, and transaction history appear in the user’s profile.

Usage tips:
- Test mode should be used for development
- Webhooks update donation statuses automatically
- Always verify payment success before finalizing a donor request

---

## APIs and data flow

- Axios instances handle API calls to Firebase or external services
- Data flow is designed to be resilient to network interruptions
- Errors are surfaced clearly to users with actionable feedback

Common flows:
- User signs up → Firebase Auth creates account → Firestore stores profile data
- User searches for donors → Real-time queries return results → User selects a donor → Request is created and tracked
- Admin updates donor status → Client receives real-time updates and reflects changes

Example API usage (pseudo):
- GET /donors?lat=...&lon=...&radius=...
- POST /requests with donorId and request details
- PUT /donors/{id} to update availability

Note: The actual endpoints depend on your Firebase rules and any middle-tier you add.

---

## Testing and quality assurance

- Unit tests cover key utilities and components
- Integration tests validate critical flows like sign-in, search, and request creation
- End-to-end tests simulate real user journeys
- Linting and formatting run on pre-commit

Local testing tips:
- Run tests with npm run test
- Use npm run lint to keep code clean
- Run type checks if TypeScript is used: npm run type-check

Test data:
- Use mock Firestore data during tests
- Seed scripts can populate a known test dataset
